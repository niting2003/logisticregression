##This is a New file created for logistic regression in my window system##
##Load the Dataset and run Numerical & Graphical Summary by Opening library and attach dataset.
> library(ISLR)
> attach (Smarket)
##Split the data set into Two data set Training and Testing Data Set.
   > training = (Year < 2005)
   > testing = !training
   > training_data = Smarket[training, ]
   > testing_data = Smarket[testing,]
   > Direction_testing = Direction[testing]
First Load the Library(CaTools)
##Fit Logistic regression model using training data.
   > stock_model = glm(Direction~ Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume, data= training_data, family = binomial)

##Use the Fitted model  to do Prediction for the Test Data
    > model_pred_Direction = rep("Down", 252)
    > model_pred_Direction[model_pred_proba >0.5] = "Up"
    > View(model_pred_Direction)
##Create Confusion matrix using & compute miscalssification rate.
    > table(model_pred_Direction, Direction_testing)
    > mean(model_pred_Direction !=Direction_testing)
